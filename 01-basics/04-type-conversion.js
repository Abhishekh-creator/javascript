// In programming, type conversion or type casting is the process of explicitly converting a value from one type to another. For instance, you may have a string value of '5' and you want to convert it to a number value of 5 so that you can do some arithmetic operations on it. 

let amount = 0;

/**** Change string to number *****/
// amount = parseInt(amount)
// amount = +amount
// amount = Number(amount)

/******Change number to string*******/ 
// amount = amount.toString()
// amount = String(amount)

/******Change string to decimal*******/
// amount = parseFloat(amount)

/********Convert number to boolean*********/

amount = Boolean(amount)
console.log(amount, typeof amount)
