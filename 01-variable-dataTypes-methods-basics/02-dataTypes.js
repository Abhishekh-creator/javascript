    //string = A string is a "string" of characters wrapped in either single or double quotes. Strings can include any number, letter or symbol.
    // boolean => Boolean represents a logical entity and can have only two values: true or false.
    // null => null is just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
    // undefined => A variable that has not been assigned a value is undefined.
    /*
    undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
    Also, undefined and null are two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object
